/**
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This class implements two steps , running command and printing report to log. 
 * 
 *  1) Running command or several commands on CLI .<br>
 *  
 *     When running command or several commands:<br> 
 *     - If enterFlag is off , there is "Enter" action sent after every command ,<br> 
 *     - The whole results of running command or commands are saved , <br>
 *     - When errors array include expected error messages for the command , they will be searched<br> 
 *     	 at the results , in case of finding one of the error messages at the result buffer,<br>
 *       the test will be declared as failed (if errorIgnore flag not raised). <br>
 *   
 *  2)  Making Report. <br>
 *  	Running Analyzers on the result. Seraching the text in the results and printing the right message.<br>  
 *		If an erros has been occured during running command , report printing right message for that error.<br>
 *
 *
 *
 * Properties description
 * 
 * ---Input properties---
 * 
 * commands - Array of commands to run in CLI , when there are several commands , they runnig at once , 
 * 			  just an "enter" inserted after every command.
 * 
 * timeout - Time to wait for command execution until throwing error and declaring the command as failed.
 * 
 * errors - Array of error messages that will be searched at the results , 
 * 			in case of match , the command will be declared as failed.
 * 
 * musts - Array of strings that must be appear at the result, if one of the musts did not appear , 
 * 		   the test declared as failed.
 * 
 * addEnter - Flag that defines if "enter" will be inserted after inserting command, 
 * 			  true value will add "enter" and false will not insert "enter" and 
 * 			  will just wait for additional char or string to insert , 
 * 			  useful on platforms with no "enter" needed after inserting some chars 
 * 			  Example:  Cisco IOS - "show ?" will be accepted as command .
 * 
 * position - Position in the CLI hierarchy\mode
 * 			  Example : " router(config)# " and " router# " are prompts of two different modes 
 * 			  and every mode has its own commands to run,
 * 			  every position has commands defined in every system object (CiscoCliCommand class for example)
 * 
 * delayTyping - Flag that defines a way of sending the command string to CLI , 
 * 				 if false - a whole command will be sent as one string , 
 * 				 if true - the command will be sent letter by letter.
 *   
 * result - Result that appears after running the command, if there is several commands , 
 * 			all of the results of every command will be buffered.
 * 
 * thrown - Exception that thrown in case of error, used just to save an exception itself ,if it was thrown.
 * 
 * failed - Flag that defines if the command ran successfully or not, can be manually changed also.
 * 
 * retryString - If defined , this string will be searched in result and in found case , 
 * 				 the command will run again and will be retried while receiving the string , 
 * 				 if string will be found again and again , the command will be declared as failed ,
 * 				 if the string will not be found , the test will move on. 
 * 				 used also as flag for retry and checked if not equal to null.
 * 
 * numberOfRetries - Number of retry times to run a command in case of retryString is not null.
 *  
 * delayInRetries - Delay between sending command retry in case of retryString is not null.
 * 
 * ---Output properties---
 * 
 * ignoreErrors - Flag that defines an ignore of error messages matching , 
 * 			      default is false , but when true and one of the error messages found in the results ,
 * 				  the test will not be declared as false.
 * 
 * promptString - Prompt string that expected when running command , 
 * 				  with ignoring previously implemented prompts in the CliConnection class.
 * 
 * properties - Table of keys and values from String type to look in the command .
 * 				This HashTable include keys (string to search in the command) 
 * 				and values (string to change with in case of key match). 
 * 				in case of finding the match , the value in the command will be changed with value in the HashTable.
 * 				The value to change in the command must be between "< >" chars, in order to SystemObject catch it.
 * 			    Example. Command - "this is a <value1> command" when value1 is "test" string, the command 
 * 				that will be sent to device will be "this is a test command".
 * 				
 *  
 * failCause - String with fail cause message , this message appears in the log, 
 * 			   not given to be changed manually.
 * 
 * silent - Flag that defines if a command will be shown in log or will run in the background.
 * 
 * analyzers - Vector that contains analyzers of the command (FindText and TextNotFound analyzers), 
 * 			   used by error array and other additional strings to search in the results,
 * 			   FindText analyzer - will declare failed command if text was not found
 * 			   TextNotFound analyzer  - this analyzer is used in the error search , 
 * 			   							will declare failed command if text was found. 
 *  
 * prompts - Array of prompts for the command , defined in CliConnection class.
